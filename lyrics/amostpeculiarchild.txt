When he was old enough to understand the truth,
the fairy folk explained how he had come to them:
he washed ashore, and so they raised him, through his youth,
and named him for the fox he wore, an orange gem.
A most peculiar child, always asking, “why,”
the boy constructed great contraptions and machines,
and traded with the merchants that were passing by,
and grew to wonder what was out beyond the greens.
