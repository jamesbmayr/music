you're a little teapot
porcelain and chrome
how I wonder how you made your
way into my home

broken little teacup
have you many holes?
someone must be making more
with pieces that they stole

sometimes there's no undoing
sometimes there's trouble brewing
sometimes there's me and you
and we get through it

make a little tea
mon cheri, dormez vous?
hush little darling, don't wake up
and I'll have a cup or two

spill a little tea, well
that's the way it goes
earl grey runs across the floor
with pieces white as snow

sometimes there's no regluing
sometimes there's no solution
sometimes it's something new
but we get through it, yes we do, yes we do, yes we do it, do it

I'll read the little tea leaves
once upon a star
tell me we're together yet
no matter where you are

fiddle with your t-shirt
polyester threads
say goodbye and close my eyes
and climb back into bed

sometimes there's something stewing
accruing and accruing
but rest the prosecution
there's nothing to it, to it, to it, to it, to it

sometimes our rendezvous-ing
sometimes could use renewing
but then, before you knew it
we get through it, through it, through it, through it, we get through it
