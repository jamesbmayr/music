Tell me what you’re up to
Tell me what your plans are
Isn’t it enough to
know I need an answer?
Tell me when you’re going
Tell me when you get back
I feel better knowing
How could you forget that?

Tell me you won’t leave me,
Tell me that you need me,
Tell me, I’ll believe you
do

Tell me, who’s your new friend?
Do you like it better
on the days that you spend
all your time together?
Tell me, do you miss me
when you’re in your own world?
Tell me, would you kiss me
if I wasn’t your girl?

Tell me you won’t leave me,
Tell me that you need me,
Tell me, I’ll believe you
do

Tell me that you’re lonely
when I’m not around you
Tell me I’m the only
sound you let surround you
Tell me when the stars shine
none of them are brighter
Tell me that you’re all mine
and you can hold me tighter

Tell me you won’t leave me,
Tell me that you need me,
Tell me, I’ll believe you
do

Tell me you won’t leave me,
Tell me that you need me,
Tell me, I’ll believe you
do

Tell me that you trust me,
Tell me that we must be,
Tell me I’m your best friend
Tell me you’re obsessed and
Tell me that you need me,
Tell me, I’ll believe you
do
(Tell me, I'll believe you)
(Tell me, I'll believe you)
(Tell me, I'll believe you)
(do)
