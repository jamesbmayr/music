It's been a long time
since I looked in your eyes
It's always a lie
when they say the time flies
So try to be honest;
is it cold in the earth?
It isn't the hottest up here
for whatever it's worth

I always will miss you
I'm sure that it shows
but I'll never forgive you
for letting me go
I'll always be with you
I hope that you know
I wish I could kiss you
I wish you were home

The snow is not white
The sky is not blue
The day is not bright
Not much of a view
Your smile is missing
Your laughter is gone
But then when I listen
I guess time ticks on

I always will miss you
I'm sure that it shows
but I'll never forgive you
for letting me go
I'll always be with you
I hope that you know
I wish I could kiss you
I wish you were home

One day I suppose
I'll come to my end
But for all I know
We'll be together again
