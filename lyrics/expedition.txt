[intro]

Across the wilderness
beyond the sea
we seek adventure,
and opportunity
The stars will guide us
wherever we may roam
So pack your courage,
let it take you far from home

[chorus]
And lose yourself in wanderlust
and cast your compass North
there's danger out beyond the dust
where we are setting forth
We ride for lands uncharted,
to where no one else has gone
If home is where your heart is,
home is out there - the expedition's on

[brass duet]

Through rain and thunder,
against the wind,
I'll have your back whenever
peril has you pinned
The wild's waiting
for us to chart a course
And we will take the world
by fearlessness and force

[chorus]
So lose yourself in wanderlust
and cast your compass North
there's danger out beyond the dust
where we are setting forth
We ride for lands uncharted,
to where no one else has gone
If home is where your heart is,
home is out there - the expedition's on

[bridge]
The world is ours for the taking
The world is ours for the taking

[chorus]
So lose yourself in wanderlust
and cast your compass North
there's danger out beyond the dust
where we are setting forth
We ride for lands uncharted,
to where no one else has gone
If home is where your heart is,
home is out there - the expedition's on

[brass duet]
