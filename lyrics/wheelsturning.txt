Turning and turning and turning and turning
a wheel overwound, going round, and I'm yearning
to be free, and learning
I can't be.

Spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning
I'm trained by the pain of the chains that are pinning
the gears on, but not when the
fear's gone

The sickening ticking and tocking and clicking
are clocking a speed never seen, and we're quickening
faster, faster, faster, for the
master

Loosen the screws, throw your shoes in the gears
and the truth will appear in the clearest of hues
Is it real, though? Not when the
wheels go turning round and round.
