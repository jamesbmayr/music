This can't last forever,
whether you know it now or not,
and whatever you forgot
will find its way to you

The truth will cast a shadow,
but you had no hope escaping
take a look at what is shaping
up and staying true

None of this is real, you're in a dream
And one by one, they'll notice what you're up to.
Every string is tearing at the seam,
but in between, it seems to be enough for you

None of this is real, you're in a dream
