Cast your doubt
so we can get it out of the way
and I'll be moving along
Got no time
for why and how and only okay.
'cause I'll be proving you wrong

One two three
I'm free of your foreshadowing.
see me as I'm making a mark
three two one
I'm done with underestimating
gonna hit it out of the park

All caught up?
You thought you had me all figured out,
but you ain't got a clue.
Watch me go,
I know what I've been talking about
and what I'm gonna do.

You'll see my name
electrifying over the streets,
and you'll be walking below.
Fortune, fame,
it's all the same, I'll have it complete
and you'll have nothing to show.

There's always another day
for starting to make a change
It's only a small delay
I know if I keep hoping, things
are going to go my way

Someday soon
you'll clue into the questioning
testing my emotional health.
Sing my tune
or ruin your own, and second-guessing?
Keep that shit to yourself.

Ten years down
the road, I know I've only started
only holding out for a sign
When we're bound
for breaking ground, the hardest part is
waiting for the stars to align

But have no fear
It's clear to me I'll be it all
I call it how I know it'll be
From there to here
It's barely just a little more
I'm sure before I know it, you'll see.
