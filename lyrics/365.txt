When the wind is blowing, and the sky is snowing,
if you think I'm going, you'd be wrong.
'Cause from the winter's cold till the months grow old,
I'm gonna love you the whole year long.

When the rains are pouring down
And the flowers blossom out of the ground
And humming birds like you've never heard, start to sing the song,
Girl, I'm gonna love you the whole year long.

When the sun is shining bright
And when we sneak off to the beach at night
Sitting on the sand, and holding hands- that's where I belong
'Cause, girl, I'm gonna love you the whole year long.

When the leaves turn red and gold
You'll still have my hand to hold
From the afternoon to the glowing moon, with the breezes blowing strong
Girl, I'm gonna love you the whole year long.

Well, the ice is setting in.
And December's looking thin.
But if you think we're breakin' up, then, baby, you'd be wrong.
'Cause girl, I'm gonna love you the whole year long.

Girl, I'm gonna love you the whole year long.
