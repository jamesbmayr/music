I met the elf a year ago this afternoon.
He looked into the distance as he spoke to me
of flesh and blood, and changing them to be immune,
and how he knew the answer was across the sea.
I came to be the captain, for his time was spent
with glass and flame and tattered books, and asking, "why?"
And when he said he'd try it, I knew what he meant.
But he was wrong, and so he knows that he will die.
