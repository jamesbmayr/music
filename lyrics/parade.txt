Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
marching to a steady drumming
bristle-skins and rhythm numbing
Men in boots and suits are coming.

Right arm, left arm, right arm, left arm
straight ahead the eyes are gazing
down the road the Men are blazing
firm and fixed and all-amazing.

No!
I won’t let you do this!
You will let us through, Miss.
You’re blind and the truth is-
You’re simply mistaken.

This is degradation!
You’re in violation.
Break out of formation!
Your life will be taken.

Left eye and right eye and left eye and right eye
she’s standing alone on the long boulevard
with her arms and her feet planted firmly and hard
but a pane of stained glass is made out of its shards

Right out, left out, write-up, left
upon the dissident they came.
Halt and turn, present and aim,
and pull, release, it’s all the same.
