[intro]

Summertime
sixteen
been on my mind
say what I mean
break a bond
break a heart
then move on
and restart

[piano solo]

Share a year
with someone new
the quiet fear
it isn't true
what's this about
where's it from
so drag it out
the time has come

[voice solo]

Simply friends
then something more
we pretend
and we ignore
there's something wrong
this isn't right
we don't belong
one winter night

[flute solo]

So long ago
there was only you
until my soul
was split in two
no malintent
this isn't blame
but now I'm bent
to do the same
