Summertime
sixteen
been on my mind
say what I mean
break a bond
break a heart
then move on
and restart

Share a year
with someone new
the quiet fear
it isn't true
what's this about
where's it from
so drag it out
the time has come

Simply friends
then something more
we pretend
and we ignore
there's something wrong
this isn't right
we don't belong
one winter night

So long ago
there was only you
until my soul
was split in two
no malintent
this isn't blame
but now I'm bent
to do the same
