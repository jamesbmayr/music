Well, I
I keep asking why
I keep holding out
when I just want to shout
that this is goodbye.

'Cause we
we could never be
the best we could do.
It's not me, babe, it's you,
and I want to be free.

I'd lie and smile all about
the hopes we had, so out of range.
But now we're simply strangers
wishful thinking things could change.

And so
the answer is no.
We keep pushing back
from the heartbreak attack,
but you've got to go.

You'll cry and dial up that old
nostalgic nonsense, suck me in.
But now I see the window's
just a mirror wearing thin.

'Cause we
we could never be
the best we could do.
It's not me, babe, it's you,
and I want to be free.

So, I
I keep asking why
I keep holding out
when I just want to shout
that this is goodbye.

Yeah, I
I keep asking why
I keep holding out
when I just want to shout
darling, this is goodbye.
