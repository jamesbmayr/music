[intro]

Way back when,
they'd spend their seconds
guessing what
they'd be
And now and then
they can remember
messing up
the dream

Trapped in
snap decisions,
wishing
applications through
collapse the
happenstance
map the plans
as they come true

Swallow your emotions
settle for the better
of whatever
of the two.
Everything's in motion
and you know
it's gonna get
away from you

[bridge]

Years go by,
they try to find
the time to keep
in touch,
but eye to eye
is nullified
by never
seeing much

Common ground
erodes around them,
flowing out
to sea,
until they've found
they're drowning in
the sound
of memory

Swallow your emotions
settle for the better
of whatever
of the two.
Everything's in motion
and you know
it's gonna get
away from you

[bridge]

Swallow your emotions
settle for the better
of whatever
of the two.
Everything's in motion
and you know
it's gonna get
away from you
