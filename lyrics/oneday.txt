One day the earth will fall into the sun
and when I face the fire, I’m not gonna run
and if the blinding light irradiates the shade
I’ll never need to hide or need to feel afraid.

One day the moon will crash across the plains
and I’ll be standing there to see the fire rains
Admire mountains as they melt into the sea
as long as you will be there, watching them with me

One day, we’ll watch the sky
flow out with the tide.
That’s how I want to die, 
sitting by your side.

One day the world will turn to ash and rust;
the sky of stars will disappear behind the dust
and when the flame has burned itself to black
there might be nothing left, but I’ll still have your back.

One day, we’ll watch the sky
flow out with the tide.
That’s how I want to die, 
sitting by your side.

One day, we’ll watch the sky
flow out with the tide.
That’s how I want to die, 
sitting by your side.
