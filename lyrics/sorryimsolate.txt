Maybe the stars are aligning 
All that I know is that it's time
Baby, the moon, see it shining?
Fall into you, so we can climb

Heartbeat, I can't keep you steady
Soar like the sun, can't take it slow
Swept off my feet, and I'm ready
Four, three, two, one, and here we go

I'll be your soul mate
and we can play tempting fate
Sorry I'm so late,
but would you say, worth the wait?

Wander the world of your outline
and when I breathe, you are the air,
with fingers curled, it’s about time
so, baby, please, just take me there.

We’ll improvise for the thrill and
we’ll tear the daylight at the seam
Open your eyes, and I’ll fill them
and drift away into a dream

I'll be your soul mate
and we can play tempting fate
Sorry I'm so late,
but would you say, worth the wait?

So this is home, where the heart is,
my heart you stole, and got hold of
So every moment I part with
I feel my soul fall more in love

I'll be your soul mate
and we can play tempting fate
Sorry I'm so late,
but would you say, worth the wait?
