[Hail to the Chief]

Born to be a farmer in a frontier state
He fell in love with music at the age of eight
Bought himself some strings and he said, "I can't wait
I've got some buddies that I need to go emancipate"

Sax solo

Got himself a groupie named Mary Todd
She played a mean tambourine with a smokin' bod
Made his way to Congress through the Douglas debates
to make the best damn band in these United States

Abraham Lincoln was a rock star
a Kentucky boy with a Hendrix heart
a regular Morello with an Illinois start
when he plays his patriotic guitar

[Star Spangled Banner]

He sponsored Andrew Johnson to rock out on the drums
but the bassist was a racist with dysfunctional thumbs
They found a better player named Ulysses S Grant
and the Union signed up for a battle of the bands

Abraham Lincoln was a rock star
a Kentucky boy with a Hendrix heart
a regular Morello with an Illinois start
when he plays his patriotic guitar

[America the Beautiful]

Now Jefferson Davis and Robert E Lee
seceded to form a new scene,
the Confederacy

[Battle Hymn of the Republic]

John Brown's body danced in a grave
said Lincoln in song: "It's been too long,
you've got to free the slaves!"

Civil War

After Appomattox when the dust settled down
the Southern brothers and their band, they were run out of town
There never was a better strummin' thumb to this day
than the one that went and red, white, and blew them away

Abraham Lincoln was a rock star
a Kentucky boy with a Hendrix heart
a regular Morello with an Illinois start
when he plays his patriotic guitar
