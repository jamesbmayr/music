Intimidated by a canvas painted white,
the empty silence is the sound that fills my sight.
Holding pen and paper tight, and still, I don’t know what to write.
Choose the brightest of the hues, would you be my muse?

Would you be my muse? ‘Cause I could use some inspiration.
There’s no time to lose, and I need you, imagination.
Like fireflies inside my mind, alighting white and blue, you shine,
illuminating new creation, would you be my muse?

You are the morning star, and near and far, you’ve shone.
And from disaster’s ashes, firebird, you’ve flown.
Don’t leave me alone, you know I’m useless on my own,
I turn to stone without you glowing through me, would you be my muse?

Would you be my muse? ‘Cause I could use some inspiration.
There’s no time to lose, and I need you, imagination.
Like fireflies inside my mind, alighting white and blue, you shine,
illuminating new creation, would you be my muse?

Would you be my muse? ‘Cause I could use some inspiration.
There’s no time to lose, and I need you, imagination.
Like fireflies inside my mind, alighting white and blue, you shine,
illuminating new creation, would you be my muse?

Would you be my muse?
