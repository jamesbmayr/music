He wouldn't dare to risk the lives of fairy folk,
and so they wandered onwards, to a cavern deep.
But in the dark, a voice of ancient power spoke;

She told them of the sunken ship, the treasures lost,
the few she found, the broken clock, the magic tome.
She kept them safe from warriors and winter frost,
until the two were old enough to journey home.
