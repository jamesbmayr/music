The sun hangs high above the plains
The wind is whispering about the rain
And as the light begins to wane
this is the quiet before the hurricane

They say the clouds will fill the skies
They say the riverbanks will rise
They say to stock up on supplies
so buy them by the crate
and hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and wait

I hear the rain against the glass
the leaves are lifted off the grass
I see the flicker and the flash
the crash is coming late,
so hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and wait

And when the dust has settled down
and we return from underground,
the eerie quiet all around
begins to filter through the town
but listen close and you can hear the sound

The lighting rips across the gray
The thunderstorm is here to stay
The wind would carry us away
today we meet our fate
so hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and wait.
