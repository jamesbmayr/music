Kick back, relax, take a
break, you deserve it.
Thoughts of the long-view just
make you look nervous.
Slouch on the couch, the T-
-V’s your escape, ‘cause
you’ve got to-
-morrow for seizing the day

Admire the moon, but it’s
soon afternoon, and your
time flies away like a
skybound balloon.
Now it’s tomorrow, the
hours you borrowed are
spent, ‘cause you rented your
seconds for sorrow. 

Another midnight rings tonight
Another finish brings to light
Another window sinking tight
with every swing, pendulum, swing

Sunset and sunrise, till
you’ve spent your nine lives
gazing through glass as the
past rushes by
Live for distractions and
self-satisfaction, and
scream that your dreams ne-
-ver seem to gain traction.

Another midnight rings tonight
Another finish brings to light
Another window sinking tight
with every swing, pendulum, swing

There goes a minute and
everything in it. Your
plan’s at a standstill; you’ll
never begin it. The
flame you remember in-
-side ebbs to embers as
next January be-
-comes last December.

Another midnight rings tonight
Another finish brings to light
Another window sinking tight
with every swing, pendulum, swing

Another midnight rings tonight
Another finish brings to light
Another window sinking tight
with every swing, pendulum, swing

Swing, swing, swing, pendulum.
Swing, swing, swing, pendulum.
Swing, swing, swing, pendulum.
Swing, swing, swing, pendulum, swing.
