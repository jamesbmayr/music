I feel the sunlight
as it seeps into my skin
the city garden
is in bloom
the dogwood branches
are swaying in the wind
I'll wait away
the afternoon

A perfect scene, here
the colors never fade
nothing gray is
getting through
The grass is green here,
but I'd like a brighter shade
and myself, I'm
feeling blue

Sunshine, melt away
the madness
I could swear I
had this all before
It's bad enough to miss you
but the momentary bliss, you
can bet I'll reminisce
some more

The park is closing
and I know I have to go
but when I leave,
the dream'll end
The dark arose
all around the afterglow
I close my eyes
and I pretend

Sunshine, melt away
the madness
I could swear I
had this all before
It's bad enough to miss you
but the momentary bliss, you
can bet I'll reminisce
some more

Sunshine, melt away
the madness
I could swear I
had this all before
It's bad enough to miss you
but the momentary bliss, you
can bet I'll reminisce
some more
