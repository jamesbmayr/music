When I was still a boy, the proclamations came:
the world would bury Edilar in one attack,
for, wrested from the clutches of a dragon's flame,
a band of men had found a bomb, and brought it back.
I watched our town militia leave the morning bay.
I saw the galleys sail into the setting sun.
I listened for the word that they had won the day:
the elves would lose the war before it had begun.
