So how's it been?
It's been a while
They say it's not the time,
it's the miles.
So tell me everything,
and tell me more
and we'll pick up where
we left off before

I heard the news;
it travels slow.
It seems like yesterday that
it was years ago.
What happened to the future
we were planning for?
But we'll pick up where
we left off before.

Do you remember when
we used to run the town?
And everyday a new way to
turn it upside-down
The weather's worn me out,
'cause when it rains, it pours,
so how can I pick up where 
we left off before?

The names you say
don’t ring a bell
‘cause they belong to new friends,
I can tell
My life has changed a lot
and so has yours
but we’ll pick up where
we left off before.

Just call me up
next time you're near
and keep in touch, there's so much
that I would want to hear.
We're still the best of friends
and we can both be sure
that we'll pick up where
we left off before.
