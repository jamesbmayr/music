(lyrics by Cyndi Lauper & Rob Hyman)

Lying in my bed,
I hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion
Is nothing new

Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me
And I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me,
I can't hear
What you have said

You say, "go so slow"
And I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering
If I'm okay

Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
