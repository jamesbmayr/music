interconnected
they bind your mind to mine
and everything is fine
you don't suspect it

overprotected
you try to find the time
for getting out of line
but they'll detect it

you can have your favorite color
you can choose from black and blue
the day's a little duller
when the light shines through

you can keep your secrets sleeping
you can take them to your grave
don't misbehave, they keep the sheep
secure but you're a data slave

superselected
today you have a say
but the only choice today
already elected

aftereffected
you pray they stay away
my friend, you've gone astray
and we'll correct it

you can have your favorite color
you can choose from black and blue
the day's a little duller
when the light shines through

you can keep your secrets sleeping
you can take them to your grave
don't misbehave, they keep the sheep
secure but you're a data slave

you can have your favorite color
you can choose from black and blue
the day's a little duller
when the light shines through

you can keep your secrets sleeping
you can take them to your grave
don't misbehave, they keep the sheep
secure but you're a data slave
