drift away along
a breezy afternoon
seize the daydream, for
the moon is rising soon

leave the madness at
the last hotel and fly
each goodbye can be
a part of me, depart to see
the sky

paused in time inside
this hideaway caf√©
where tomorrow takes
the place of yesterday

the current washes over,
sandy waves go by
a deep serenity,
it enters my identity

and I
I'm out here on my own
and all I've ever known
will drift away, drift away

and I
I won't be going home
take down the cornerstone
it falls away, falls away, falls away

there's no undoing
all the stupid things I've done
review is overdue
but I'll be on the run

the crease across the map
it traps me in the afterclap
of blunders, going under,
and I wonder why I'd even try

so I
I'm out here on my own
and all I've ever known
will drift away, drift away

and I
I won't be going home
take down the cornerstone
it falls away, falls away, falls a-

weight
off my shoulders
I'm getting older
and I can't hold on to

before
so I'm at your door
I can't restore it
or ignore it anymore

what do I do now
what do I do now
what do I do now
what do I do now

what do I do now
what do I do now
what do I do now
what do I do now
