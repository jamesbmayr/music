[intro]

I might try
I could just give in,
forgive him
for living a lie

I'll find time,
hiding from spies
inside of my
mind

[solos]

We can't see,
frequently keeping
up secrets and
heaping them high

He might be
seeing it creep
while I'm sleeping
it by

[bridge]

Through that door,
I'm on the floor and
I'm poring through
all of the lore

So, no more
ignoring the core
we're enduring
it for

(outro)
I keep checking
the feed
and I can't
get a read

I'll be ready
to let it get better
forever
and so I concede
