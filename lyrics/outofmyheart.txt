You don’t have to tell me to go...
I’m already unsteady and heading for home.
You don’t have to show me the door.
It seems to me that I’ve seen this before.
I already know that you think
I’m to blame; in this game, I’m the weakest link.
So I don’t want to hear anymore
'cause I don’t want war...

Can somebody please tell me why it took so long
for me to start to see your heart is not where I belong?
I put two and two together, and it’s breaking us apart
so please get out of my heart

I look in the mirror and see
somebody other than who I should be.
I close my eyes and I look
through our rip-roaring rainy day memory book.
There’s plenty of fish in the sea.
That’s the tale that they fail to make me believe
'cause I’m still on the end of the hook
This is the end of the friendship and look what it took.

Can somebody please tell me why it took so long
for me to start to see your heart is not where I belong?
I put two and two together, and it’s breaking us apart
so please get out of my heart
