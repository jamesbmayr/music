take the late train far away from home
filled with people feeling all alone
he pays the fare, he's going nowhere
and he'll get there on his own

he leans his head against the dirty glass
sees the trees and streets and people pass
leave the station, in resignation
no destination, but he'll get there fast

she packs her baggage, leaves it all behind
finds a train departing overtime
and soon the city's gone, she's got her headphones on
projects a calm, pretending that she's fine

out the window, she can see the tracks
parallel forever, front and back
they're cutting through, the perfect view
of green and blue, until it fades to black

across the platform, there's a passing train
paused a moment in the pouring rain
and for a time, their eyes align
and in the shining light, it's all okay

he sees perfection in her pretty face
she looks at him, her heart begins to race
they share a smile, but in a while
they're making miles to another place
