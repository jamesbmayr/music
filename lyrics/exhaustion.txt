Fight the monsters in your mind.
I'll be waiting here beside you when you rise.
When the war is won, you'll find
I'll be waiting when you open up your eyes.

Every hour passing by
makes it harder - get me far away tonight.
Dawn is drawing on the sky.
Come there with me, run into the morning light.

I don't care what you decide.
You can't go, I won't allow it, be all right.
So I will stay here by your side,
and when you wake up, I'll be waiting,

I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting,
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting,
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting,
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting...
