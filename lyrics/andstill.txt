unburdened youth
in search of truth,
surviving tooth and nail,
we make our crew
to take us through,
alive with steadied sail.

in days of old
so brazen bold,
the ways they sold the tale;
with what they teach
far out of reach,
took each a different trail

and bit by bit
through luck and grit
we struck our little lots,
but we have grown
in time alone,
the world we've known, forgot

yet gather us,
blow off the dust,
and trust that we transcend
those days apart,
for we restart,
and soon depart as friends

to distant shores
and evermores,
our long befores are done;
from undergrad
to ironclad,
we had a decent run

but now and then,
no knowing when,
we'll once again depend
on ties we set
and can't forget,
for we will yet be friends

should years go by
when you and I
do not a signal send,
be free of fear,
and see it clear:
for we are here as friends

so come whatever
no one can sever
this bond that never will bend
for I'm here till
my time's fulfilled...
and still, we will be friends

so come whatever
no one can sever
this bond that never will bend
for I'm here till
my time's fulfilled...
and still, we will be friends
and still, we will be friends
