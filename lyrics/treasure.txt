Before the sun had risen o'er the misty mornin' shore,
a fisherman had waded out, and laid aside his oars
he set his net, and hauled it all, but naught was caught between
'cept an oyster with the biggest, finest, pearl he'd ever seen

A scoundrel setting out to sea, to sail the open skies
had hardly left the harbor when a shimmer caught his eye
he squealed the wheel to plow the bow and split the little craft
and as he dove to claim the pearl himself, the pirate laughed:

You'll never take me under
and you'll never take me plunder
If you make me, then I'll take it to
the bottom of the sea
You can spend your days up trying
till you're old and cold and dying
but you'll never take the treasure
and you'll never shackle me

The fisherman devoted all his savings to a ship
and swore he'd never stop until the pearl was in his grip
but if the skiff should find a kinder breeze, then he would hear,
the wind would bring the taunting of the thieving buccaneer:

You'll never take me under
and you'll never take me plunder
If you make me, then I'll take it to
the bottom of the sea
You can spend your days up trying
till you're old and cold and dying
but you'll never take the treasure
and you'll never shackle me

One afternoon, the captain, in the cabin of his boat
turned to see the fisherman with a blade against his throat
until the villain's bird conferred the jewel into her beak
and as she flew into the setting sun, they heard the parrot speak:

You'll never take me under
and you'll never take me plunder
If you make me, then I'll take it to
the bottom of the sea
You can spend your days up trying
till you're old and cold and dying
but you'll never take the treasure
and you'll never shackle me

Never take the treasure
and you'll never shackle me
