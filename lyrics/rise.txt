Once it was the world was ours,
every one of us a king,
from the soil to the stars,
though we didn’t have a thing.
In the shadow of the trees,
all across the silver shore,
anyone could feel the breeze.
Who could ever ask for more?

Can you feel that driving force?
Can you feel it in your veins?
Saddle up and set the course;
time to tame the wild plains.
This is how the lines are drawn:
carve your quarter of the west.
You can claim the day at dawn;
such is fortune manifest.

So the riches never came.
So it seems we were betrayed.
Now, with nothing to my name,
now it’s time for me to fade.
Sorry, father, I have sinned.
I’m about to cross the line.
But you cannot keep me pinned,
and I will not be confined.

You can’t keep us down.
You can’t keep us down.
You can’t keep us down.
You can’t keep us down.

You can’t keep us down. (Rise!)
You can’t keep us down. (Rise!)
You can’t keep us down. (Rise!)
You can’t keep us down. (Rise!)
