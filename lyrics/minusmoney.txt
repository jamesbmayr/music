Fast into finance with my MBA,
rising up the front-office ranks.
Hold, together, momma, it'll be okay;
someday you'll see me running the bank.

Some would call it subprime, I say, triple A,
now pack 'em up and leave 'em alone.
Tally up the quarter, and calculate pay,
and someone throw the watchdog a bone.

Break the Glass to make it sunny.
Swim in liquid risk till we drown.
Can't you see the minus money?
Watch it make the world go round.

Sharing with the shadows 'cause they're faster than light
till everybody's holding a share
propping up my promises is gonna be tight
since there was never anything there.

Fifty years of careful, said my momma to me,
and what have I got to show?
Used to have a home, somewhere in the debris;
tell me, where am I gonna go?

Break the Glass to make it sunny.
Swim in liquid risk till we drown.
Can't you see the minus money?
Watch it make the world go round.
