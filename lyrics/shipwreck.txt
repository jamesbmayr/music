In Edilar, the ships were built, to sail the sea,
to hide the elven treasure in the deepest caves.
And so it was aboard a boat, he came to be,
the baby boy, who lived along the ocean waves.
But soon the crew had reached the coast of Carasune,
and in the wind and thunder-rain, the sails were shred.
A ship had left the port beneath the crescent moon,
and rescued not a soul, but killed them all instead.
