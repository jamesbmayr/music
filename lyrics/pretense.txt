She smiles, she smiles,
but she cries inside; behind her eyes,
she knows that wherever she goes,
he's not there.

She grins, she grins,
but within the window of her mind,
she feels that this isn't real,
but she doesn't care.

Cuz when she shuts the world away,
and descends into a soothing daydream,
nothing you can say
can bring an end to wishful thinking ways,
she won't, no she won't stop until
she's in his arms.
So she waits, every day,
in her mind.

He laughs, he laughs,
but the last time it was real has passed.
He knows that they'll leave him alone
if he plays along.

He speaks, he speaks,
but his words are weak, he sneaks away
to feel her day dream appeal,
and there's nothing wrong.

Cuz when he shuts the world away,
and descends into a soothing daydream,
nothing you can say
can bring an end to wishful thinking ways,
he won't, no he won't stop until
she's in his arms.
So he waits, every day,
in his mind.

They stop.

Cuz when they shut the world away,
and descend into a soothing daydream,
nothing you can say
can bring an end to wishful thinking ways,
they hope the time will pass, faster,
bring them back again,
and soon she'll be, in his arms
in time.
