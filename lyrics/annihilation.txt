Along the shore, they landed in the dead of dark,
and broke into the castle, with a thousand blades,
and soon they set the fires from a single spark,
and slaughtered sons and daughters in their night crusade.
A man from Carasune, the boy he used to know,
had caught the couple, fleeing to the city wall.
He dropped the flute katana, and he let them go,
and so, from far away, they watched the city fall.
