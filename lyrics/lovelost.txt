Alone and safe in secrecy, he wished to stay:
the girl was growing older, but her mother, weak.
She built a sleeping chamber, sealed herself away,
till others found the cure she could no longer seek.
In misery, he took the task upon himself;
to keep her safe, he brought his daughter to a friend,
and so the dragon promised to protect the elf,
the girl who watched her father cross horizon's end.
