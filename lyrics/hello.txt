can't keep quiet, time to tell you the truth
can't keep hiding what you already knew
can't sleep, night and day dreaming of you
I do, I do, I do

making me better since we met long ago
lately seems like we've been starting to glow
I'll be by your side wherever we go
hello, hello, hello

heart aflutter, flood the sky and the sea
add your color, make it fuller and free
everything other will cease to be
except for you and me

so no more holding in what I want to say
can't control the words I have to convey
take my soul and let's get carried away
today, today, today

kind of wonderful, watching it grow
under sun and starry spring out of snow,
time goes faster, ever after in flow
hello, hello, hello
