The cat's got your tongue
but your eyes say you're young
and so naive that you don't know
what you've begun
The words from your lips
the words you let slip
can never be taken back
now that they're gone from your grips

and so you stand, shaking your hand,
watching your plans unravel
the time has slowed, but you know that
taking the road less traveled
might make it better
but it might lead to ruin
yes, you might have wrecked forever
when you told me that you loved me too soon

Goodbye, steady pace.
Hello there, arms race.
It's time to scrutinize
one another's face
Now let us suspect
and over-protect
and some of us will be
more indirect

And when we heard those three words
what we inferred was tremendous
but our preoccupation with high expectations
and good presentation could end us
and now we're lost
because you shot for the moon
no, you didn't know the cost
when you told me that you loved me too soon.

But here tonight, it's black and white,
and I can't fight this feeling
and how I've missed this simple bliss
from every kiss you're stealing
and it's enough
to show your words were true
'cause when you told me that you loved me
I told you that I loved you too
