I'd like to think the two of them will sleep in peace,
that, frozen on this very ship, he'll stay concealed,
until the day the world is ready to release
the greatest minds that it could make, but couldn't wield.
And maybe now, they hear each other's voices think
and maybe they can dream together endlessly.
For though the rest of us are gone in but a blink,
their love will live forever and will ever be.
