Thought I was living a dream.
But things aren't quite as they seem.
I hear through the screaming you're leaving tonight.
I guess that we ran out of steam.

The clues everywhere were beginning to show.
And you may not care but I'm letting you know,
I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

Left at the curb of your heart.
I guess I was falling apart.

I don't understand why you threw me away.
I know that you planned it so you'd be okay.
I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

I'll be fine without your charity.
I want you to get away from me.

And what could a "How are you doing now?" do?
No, I'll need an hour to get over you.
I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

I'll be fine. I'll be fine.
