before I knew,
you knew it was you
the only one who sees right
through me like you do
I come undone the moment
you come into view
the golden sunflower
against a sky of blue

so here is my plea
a lifelong love with me
a dream reality
your lifelong love with me

unchecked affection,
our connection's tried and true
and you reflect perfection,
echoed wide in all you do
and I find my gray designs
are colored in vibrant hues,
'cause you shine, you redefine, 
our intertwining minds will find

a hillside by the sea
a homesick melody
an ever-blooming cherry tree
a lifelong love with me

a friendship formed and grew
a question long overdue
so please agree to say, "I do"
to my lifelong love for...
you

you are the sound
that grounds me, astounds me,
surrounds me with your
voiceover song
coming through loud and strong
singing we belong as
wonderful days
with this passion ablaze,
so many ways I'm amazed by you

hand in hand in understanding
transmit my g'bye
across a fearless gleaming sea as
teal and clear as you and I
and under thunderstormy weather
down whatever avenue,
we are two souls knit together,
this endeavor is forever, me and you

you are the moon
in the late afternoon
the tidal tune that guides me 
backstory filled
with a million more thrills
and there's still so much to
seasons go by
in the blink of an eye
and I think I'm linked with

you are the spark
in the darkness, of the park
where we mark the stars we
nobody else
ever felt your sentimental
self, I melt a-
part of my life
take my heart, be my wife
for a lifelong love with you

take hold of my hand
and my soul and discover
I'm in lifelong love with you
