Another Monday morning
The world’s a wake-up warning
Get up
Put on some pants

Can’t say I like the mirror
But when I’m thinking clearer
My mind
Begins to dance

There’s no one sitting near me
I don’t think you can hear me
Somewhere
Too far away

But there’s a moment coming
And so my heartbeat’s drumming
Half of
A hundred days

That’s when your eyes will meet my own
That’s when you’ll see.
That’s when your hand will meet my own
That’s where I’ll be.

That’s when your eyes will meet my own
That’s when you’ll see.
That’s when your hand will meet my own
That’s where I’ll be.

You’re in between the faces
I recognize in places
Still you’re
Not really there

All those mistaken glances.
My wishful thinking dances
Faster
Jump off the ground

When you’re around.
