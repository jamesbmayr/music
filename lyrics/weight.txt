When I shed my mortal skin,
and descend into the earth,
weigh my days not by my sins,
but what my stay was worth.

Sum my stumbles, fumbles, flaws,
append endeavors unbegun,
take mistakes and aches I've caused
and all the damage done,

then my family and my friends,
every influence arrayed,
and unearth each word I've penned
and composition made.

Balance all the beauty built
against the times I'd try and fail,
both my greatness and my guilt,
and tell the world my tale.

When I die, recite my story,
all that I aspired for.
