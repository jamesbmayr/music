Winter:

Sing the song of solstice snow,
falling down on us below.
Bring along all those you know,
all around the bustling glow.

Cold and filled with starlight
this night of nights shall be.
But tomorrow, will we start a new year
bright and hopeful all are we.

Summer:

Sing the song of solstice sun,
ne'er outshone and ne'er outdone.
Dancing light across the waves,
beaming warmth across the days.

Breezes, through the trees, blow,
and flowers bloom at will.
So our summer carries on forever,
when we wish our time stood still.
