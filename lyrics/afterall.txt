Goodbye, summer. Hello fall.
Tell me, is it still too soon to make the call?
I remember when the distance seemed so small.
But there's no happy ever after after all.

Is his picture hanging in the hall?
Is the grass a greener shade behind the wall?
I remember sailing smooth before the stall.
But there's no happy ever after after all.

Am I the one you blame?
Do you never want to hear my name?
Or do you feel the same,
and hope one day I came?

We were in it for the life-long haul
kept the pace until we wound up at a crawl
or am I the only one who can recall?
But there's no happy ever after after all.

But there's no happy ever after after all.

But there's no happy ever after after all.
