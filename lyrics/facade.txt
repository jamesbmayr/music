[intro]

Day by day, it's getting darker,
hardly any air to breathe.
Don't say anything, be smarter and depart
for her land of make-believe.

[bridge]

One by one, she dodges questions,
guesses flying through the air.
Keep on running from confession,
always pressing on, hoping no one is aware.

[bridge]

Step by step, she shuffles onward
always gazing straight ahead
won't turn back to what is gone, move on,
and embody the facade instead.

Step by step, she shuffles onward
always gazing straight ahead
won't turn back to what is gone, move on,
and embody the facade instead.
