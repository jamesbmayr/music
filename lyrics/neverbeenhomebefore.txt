On dragon wings, they soared above the crystal seas,
and saw the summer trees and rolling hills below.
Beyond the icy mountains, in the coastal breeze,
they came to Edilar, the city lights aglow.
They found the warmest welcome in the castle-town,
and grew to love the home they'd never been before.
But fear was everywhere, and fear would bring them down;
the fear fulfilled would will them all to total war.
