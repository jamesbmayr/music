A hundred thousand years before the tale began,
he says our different races shared a single blood,
that all of us were once a single line of man,
but spread across the earth, as though we were a flood.
Our tribes have grown to city-states along the coast;
with different adaptations, life remains the same.
And though he says the race of elves evolved the most,
'tis he who lost his kingdom in the flash and flame.
