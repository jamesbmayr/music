when
will they come again?
even breathing in relief, we knew
to wonder then

here
after years of drying tears,
our fears appear again
and all our heroes are pretend

all good things must end...
all good things must end...

paradise
calm and quiet, if you buy it
sign and sacrifice
call the crisis kind of nice, goodbye to

better days
we'll remember fond decembers
and forget the ways
we were never gonna change, 'cause...

all good things must end...
all good things must end...

it starts out small
we readjust
more pieces fall
we do what we must

high iron walls
reduced to rust
and dust and plaster
after

all good things must end...
all good things must end
except for us
