Her voice inside his head grew louder every night,
so after he had built the flute into a blade,
and forged a sword himself, the elf prepared to fight,
and into Carasune, they crept, in moonless shade.

and seeing elven treasure-hordes, he understood.
The guards, too many for his ally to repel,
would chase the pair of elves into the mountain woods.
