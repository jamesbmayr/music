[intro]
[sax solo]

rusted rotors, busted
motors breaking down,
he'll be in to get the
engine spinning round

working quick to pick
the pieces in between,
in perfect pitch, he whistles,
fixing the machine

[bridge]

iron shining, redefining
steel and chrome,
burn his time until
the fires feel like home

keep it grinding, always
finding more to change
forward facing, soon the
place is looking strange

[bridge]

forty years, he clears his
morning, day, and night
fixing clicks until the
engine's ticking right

now it takes a little
longer than before
get someone stronger,
don't belong here any more

[bridge]
